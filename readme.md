Gravity Forms: Custom Entry Limit
==============================

Gravity Forms: Custom Entry Limit extends the Gravity Forms WordPress plugin by adding options for custom limiting of number of entries to a Gravity Form.

This repository is a development version intended to facilitate communication with developers. I will aim to keep it stable, but use at your own discretion.

The plugin does ping an external server to check for updates. This can be disabled by un-requiring the file `class-typewheel-updater.php`.

Pull requests are welcome.

## Usage Instructions
After installing and activating this plugin, you will find additional option under *Form Settings | Restrictions* when *Limit number of entries* is checked. Checking *Summed Fields As Entries* will utilize the total sum of values from fields you have identified in the form. Identify fields in the form by visiting a field's *Advanced* tab. Under **Field Usage**, check *Include in sum for determining form entry limit*.

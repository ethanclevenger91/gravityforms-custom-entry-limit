Gravity Forms: Custom Entry Limit
==============================

Gravity Forms: Custom Entry Limit extends the Gravity Forms WordPress plugin by adding options for custom limiting of number of entries to a Gravity Form.

This repository is a development version intended to facilitate communication with developers. I will aim to keep it stable, but use at your own discretion. Pull requests are welcome.

THIS PLUGIN IS NOT CURRENTLY COMPATIBLE WITH GRAVITY FORMS 2.5 OR GREATER

## Recommendation
This plugin was initially inspired by code snippets provided by [Gravity Wiz](https://twhl.xyz/gw/). Since initial development of this plugin, Gravity Wiz has release their own perk, [GP Limit Submissions](https://twhl.xyz/gw-ls/), which provides this same functionality along with additional options for limiting submissions. We highly recommend you use their solution, which will include reliable support and ongoing development.

## Usage Instructions
After installing and activating this plugin, you will find additional option under *Form Settings | Restrictions* when *Limit number of entries* is checked. Checking *Summed Fields As Entries* will utilize the total sum of values from fields you have identified in the form. Identify fields in the form by visiting a field's *Advanced* tab. Under **Field Usage**, check *Include in sum for determining form entry limit*.
